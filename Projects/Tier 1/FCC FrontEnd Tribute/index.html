                <h4> Legendary performer Nina Simone sang a mix of jazz, blues and folk music in the 1950s and '60s, later enjoying a career resurgence in the '80s. A staunch Civil Rights activist, she was known for tunes like "Mississippi Goddam," "Young, Gifted and Black" and "Four Women," among many others.

                <br> Born on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina, Nina Simone studied classical piano at the Juilliard School in New York City, but left early when she ran out of money.
                <br>Performing in night clubs, she turned her interest to jazz, blues and folk music and released her first album in 1957, scoring a Top 20 hit with the track "I Loves You Porgy." In the ‘60s, Simone expanded her repertory in exemplary fashion while becoming identified as a <b class="text-primary">leading voice of the Civil Rights Movement.</b>
                <br>She later lived abroad and experienced major mental health and financial issues, though enjoying a big career resurgence in the 1980s. 
                <br>
                <br> In many ways, Simone's music defied standard definitions. Her classical training showed through, no matter what genre of song she played, and she drew from a well of sources that included gospel, pop and folk. She was often called the <i><b class="text-primary">"High Priestess of Soul"</b></i> but she hated that nickname. She didn't like the label of "jazz singer," either. "If I had to be called something, it should have been a folk singer because there was more folk and blues than jazz in my playing," she later wrote in her autobiography.

                By the mid-1960s, Simone became known as a musical voice of the Civil Rights Movement. She wrote <i>"Mississippi Goddam"</i> in response to the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers and the Birmingham church bombing that killed four young African-American girls. She also penned <i>"Four Women,"</i> chronicling the complex histories of a quartet of African-American female figures, and <i>"Young, Gifted and Black"</i> borrowing the title of a play by Hansberry, which became a popular anthem.
                <br>After the assassination of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Simone's bassist Greg Taylor penned <i>"Why (The King of Love Is Dead)"</i> which was performed by the singer and her band at the Westbury Music Festival.
                <br>
                <br> In her final years, reports indicated that Nina Simone was battling breast cancer. She died at the age of 70 on April 21, 2003, at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, France. While she may be gone, Simone left a daughter & a lasting impression on the world of music, art and activism. <br><b class="text-primary">
                    She sang to share her truth, and her work still resonates with great emotion and power.
                </b>
                <br>
                <br> Simone has inspired an array of performers, including Aretha Franklin, Laura Nyro, Joni Mitchell, Lauryn Hill and Meshell Ndegeocello. Her deep, distinctive voice continues to be a popular choice for television and film soundtracks.
